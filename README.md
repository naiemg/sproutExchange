# Sprout Exchange ðŸŒ±

Sprout Exchange is an interactive transaction-based web application that connects gardeners with patrons that can contribute (monetarily) to their garden in exchange for a share of the produce.
- A gardener is defined as someone who owns any amount of yard space or land.
  - Instead of letting that space remain unused, they can use it to grow food and to make a
profit.
  - A gardener posts a proposal on the platform, complete with diagrams and other layout
specifications.
- A sponsor visits the platform and can view a list of potential investment opportunities.
  - After investing in a garden, a sponsor becomes a stakeholder, and the money raised is used to maximize the garden's potential and returns.
  
As time passes, gardeners provide their patrons with updates through the platform. At harvest, all patrons are rewarded with their share of the produce. If at any time a patron decides that they don't want to own a share of a garden anymore, they may sell their shares in a market where other patrons can buy or sell shares after the initial offering.
